        <p>Bootloader is the software algorithm that is executed during the booting of the system.
  Let’s delve deeper to understand why an Automotive ECU/Control Unit, should have software re-programming capability.
  Automotive ECUs (Control Units) support host of functionalities. These features and functionalities have grown to become more advanced and complex.
 It has become imperative for the Automotive OEMs’ and Suppliers to ensure that these software-driven control units are always operating in a secure & efficient environment.  This can be ensured only if the ECUs’ (control units), within your vehicle, have the latest and updated version of the software and security patches.  Hence, the application software designed and ported on the MCU platform needs to be updated quite frequently, either through a remote location or at the service station.  The Bootloader software, which occupies the ROM of the Electronic Control Unit, has been entrusted with this responsibility of facilitating the ECU software update..</p>

        <p>The future belongs to electromobility: This technology ensures that eco-friendly, quiet and efficient vehicles will be on our roads. There are still certain challenges to be overcome so that the many advantages of the electronic power chain can be leveraged. But the breakthrough will come about.</p>
